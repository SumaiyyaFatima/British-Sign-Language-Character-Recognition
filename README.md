British Sign Language (BSL) Character Recognition

British Sign Language Character Recognition is a real-time gesture recognition system that translates BSL hand signs into readable text using computer vision and machine learning.
The system enables seamless human-computer interaction by recognizing hand gestures captured from a webcam. Using MediaPipe for landmark detection and a Random Forest classifier for prediction, it interprets single-hand BSL alphabets accurately and efficiently.
Designed with accessibility in mind, this project aims to support communication for the hearing and speech-impaired community, providing a foundation for assistive technologies that make sign language recognition both interactive and intuitive.

Overview:

At its core, this system combines real-time computer vision with machine learning to understand and classify British Sign Language characters.
•	The application captures live video frames from the webcam.
•	MediaPipe detects and extracts key hand landmarks.
•	These features are then processed by a trained Random Forest model, which classifies the hand shape into a specific BSL alphabet.
•	The prediction is displayed instantly on the frontend, allowing users to visualize recognition results in real time.
Built using Python, OpenCV, and scikit-learn, with a lightweight web interface, the project demonstrates how deep learning-inspired models can drive inclusive, real-time communication systems.
