BRITISH SIGN LANGUAGE CHARACTER RECOGNITION

British Sign Language Character Recognition is a real-time gesture recognition system that translates BSL hand signs into readable text using computer vision and machine learning. The system captures live video input through a webcam, detects hand landmarks using Google's MediaPipe framework, and classifies the gestures using a trained Random Forest model. It focuses on single-hand BSL alphabets, offering quick and accurate interpretation of hand signs in real time.

This project is built using Python, OpenCV, and scikit-learn, along with a lightweight frontend interface for live demo interaction. It serves as a foundation for assistive technologies that aim to bridge communication gaps for the hearing and speech-impaired community. The modular design also allows easy extension to support more gestures, custom datasets, or integration with speech synthesis tools.
